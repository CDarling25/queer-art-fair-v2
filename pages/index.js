        <h1> ðŸ˜± What is Queer Art Faire? </h1>
        <p>We are a community hosting art fairs in San Francisco for <strong>marginalized</strong> folks who have not had a space to share their creations before. 
          We emphasize creating spaces for but not limited to people of color, queer community, people whose first language is not English, and people who have little to no experience vending or sharing their art. 
          We aim to create a welcoming environment for people who face imposter syndrome about sharing their art to begin their journeys. 
          We are a completely volunteer-run organization running on donations. If you want to support us, we will be offering collectible stickers at our fairs for all donations above $5 and we receive donations on Venmo: @queerartfair.
